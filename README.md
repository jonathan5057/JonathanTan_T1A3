## List of Feature 

Choose Name and location - When the user launches the system, he/she will first be prompted to enter their name followed by four selection of location for the Pizza store that is nearest to them. 

Menu Selection - Once user had entered their name, the use will then be prompted with a list of menu with the following questions: Add Order, Remove Order, Show Details, Finalized order, Exit 

Finalized order - After the user completes their selection of items on the menu, the system will display the total amount of items selected and the total cost for the bills.

Users could select from the pizza menu by selecting ADD ORDER and REMOVE ORDER to their cart if necessary until they FINALIZED ORDER with the total amount displayed to the user. The user could always go back to SHOW DETAIL to view their cart along with the pricing with each pizza choice. Once FINALIZED ORDER. The system will then proceed to the order type by asking the option of PICK UP or DELIVERY. If the user selects PICK UP, the system will end the program and print the message asking the user to pick up their order from their chosen pizza local store.
