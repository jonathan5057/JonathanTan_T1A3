### Purpose and scope 
The purpose of this application is to provide easy access for users to order their pizza meal in a more efficient way by allowing them to order online then collect from the store when the order is ready, and the option of delivery directly to their door step is also available. Hence, this would save the users so much time without having to drive to the local store and wait for the order to be ready.

### Target Audience
The target audience of this application could be anyone that craves for a pizza meal and would like to have it quicker without having to quene up in line at the store.  

### How to use it
The app firstly requires the user to select the nearest store (selection of only 4 local pizza stores) and then a short welcoming message will be prompted by asking for the user’s name. The system will then display main menu for the user to interact with. Users could select from the pizza menu and make changes to their shopping cart if necessary until they finalized their order and the system will bring them to the order details along with the total bill. The system will then proceed to the payment part and ask for cash on Delivery (COD) or credit card payment. Once payment is finalized, the system proceeds to generate an invoice number. and prompt a message by asking the user to key in their delivery address. Lastly, the system would prompt a notification of the driver’s profile name and car model of the person who is delivering the orders.
