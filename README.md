# Pizza Ordering App

# Software Development Plan

## Purpose and scope 
The app firstly requires the user to select the nearest store (selection of only 4 local pizza stores) and then a short welcoming message will be prompted by asking for the user’s name. The system will then display a list of selections to the user to interact with. Users could select from the pizza menu (Pizza, Side dish, drinks, dessert) and make changes to their cart if necessary until they finalized their order and the system will bring them to the order details along with the total bill. The system will then proceed to the payment part and ask for cash on Delivery (COD) or credit card payment. Once payment is finalized, the system proceeds to generate an invoice number. and prompt a message by asking the user to key in their delivery address. Lastly, the system would prompt a notification of the driver’s profile name and car model of the person who is delivering the orders.
