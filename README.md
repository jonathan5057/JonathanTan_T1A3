# Pizza Ordering App

# Software Development Plan

## Purpose and scope 
The app firstly requires the user to select the nearest store (selection of only 4 local pizza stores) and then a short welcoming message will be prompted by asking for the user’s name. The system will then display a list of selections to the user to interact with. Users could select from the pizza menu (Pizza, Side dish, drinks, dessert) and make changes to their cart if necessary until they finalized their order and the system will bring them to the order details along with the total bill. The system will then proceed to the payment part and ask for cash on Delivery (COD) or credit card payment. Once payment is finalized, the system proceeds to generate an invoice number. and prompt a message by asking the user to key in their delivery address. Lastly, the system would prompt a notification of the driver’s profile name and car model of the person who is delivering the orders. 

## List of Feature 

Choose Name and location - When the user launches the system, he/she will first be prompted to enter their name followed by four selection of location for the Pizza store that is nearest to them. 

Menu Selection - Once user had entered their name, the use will then be prompted with a list of menu with the following questions: Show Menu, Select Order, Edit Order, Delete Order, Exit 

Show purchase detail - After the user completes their selection of items on the menu, the system will display the total amount of items selected and the total cost for the bills. Special discount will be applied based on the total amount. If > $50 → 15%, $25 → 10%, >

Determine next move - After the payment is finalized by the user, the system will then display two options for the user to select from. The system will ask the user if they would like to pick up their order or have the order to be delivered to them. 

Deliver - If the user selects “Deliver”, the user will be prompted to enter their address for the delivery. The address will need to be the same suburbs as the store that the user selects at the beginning. Once the address has been confirmed, the system will then print “your order is currently being prepared for delivery” snooze for 4 second followed by print “Peter is delivering your pizza in white corolla”
